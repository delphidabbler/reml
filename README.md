# REML

REML is a small SGML language with that has much in common with HTML, but is much, much smaller.

It is aimed to be used to describe the format of simple, short documents.

REML was developed to describe text formatting of snippet descriptions and notes in the [DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Collection](https://github.com/delphidabbler/code-snippets). The [DelphiDabbler CodeSnip](https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip) program contains a REML interpreter and renders REML markup in its UI and printouts.

This repository contains documents that define the various versions of REML. The documents can be found in the `docs` directory.
